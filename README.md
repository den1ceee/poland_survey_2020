Hello! This my final project on course 'Data Analysis in Sociology' which took place at the end of my 2nd year of bachelor's studies.  <br>
It was made in a team of 4 people - together with my dear classmates <br><br>
Back then, we were just beginning our journey in data analysis and practicing the basics - descriptive statistics, statistical tests, correlation and regression analysis. <br><br>

## Object and aim of research

Because we were sociology students, we were limited to selecting a topic from the social sciences.
We decided on a study of social-political consumption in a Poland (where one of our classmates was originally from).<br><br>
⚡The topic of our project is 'Frequency of Media Usage and Social Trust in Poland'<br><br>
The main themes covered here are how often do people consume information about politics and current affairs, frequency of Internet usage, trust level to people, opinion on purity of intent. These variables will compared among different socio-demographic variables as age, gender, marital status, higher level of education, employment status.
## Data

ESS9-European Social Survey Round 9 2018/2019

Description from the [offical website](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) (can be found in applied PDF):<br><br>
The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically-driven multi-country survey,
which has been administered in over 35 countries to date. Its three aims are, firstly – to
monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe and to
investigate how they interact with Europe's changing institutions, secondly – to
advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in
Europe and beyond, and thirdly – to develop a series of European social indicators,
including attitudinal indicators.
